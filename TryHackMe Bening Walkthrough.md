Welcome to another one of my walkthroughs. 

Before you start this CTF is good to have finished the rooms  [splunk101](https://tryhackme.com/room/splunk101) and [splunk201](https://tryhackme.com/room/splunk201).

# Start Here

Also for your own convenience you can use a separate tab for the AttackBox by doing the following:

1. Click on the View in full screen at the bottom left of the AttackBox screen.

2. Now a new tab will open with the VM and you can close the split screen by clicking on exit split view. You now have 2 tabs one with the questions and one with the VM.
